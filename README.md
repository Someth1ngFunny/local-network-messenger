# LNMS (local-network-messenger)

LNMS is a simple messenger for communication between users in the same network via TCP & UDP sockets.

## Installation

The project may be instaleld via only CMake or only Python.

Output program is generated in `./build/(Debug | Release)/lnms`

### 1. CMake

```shell
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -B build
```

```shell
cmake --build build
```

### 2. Python

1. Create venv

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Install requirements

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt

// OR (workaround with not UTF-8 character in path)
* python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

3. Install packages

```shell
conan install .

// OR (workaround with not UTF-8 character in path)
* python .venv\Scripts\conan.exe install .
```

4. CMake activation (optional)

```shell

build/generators/conanbuild(.sh | .bat | .ps1)

// to deactivate
build/generators/deactivate_conanbuild(.sh | .bat | .ps1)

// If you need .ps1 script (POWERSHELL) rerun 3rd step with flag
// (<COMMAND> --conf=tools.env.virtualenv:powershell=<executable>)
```

5. Building via CMake

```shell
cmake --preset lnms-release
// OR DEBUG
cmake --preset lnms-debug
```

```shell
cmake --build build
```

### IDE C++ intellisense configuration

To provide to your IDE information about locations of building libraries include files you need to explicetly set the location of `compile_commands.json` file which might be generated by CMake.

CMake files are already configured to build `compile_commands.json` in `./build` directory, but they are created only if you are building via single-config generators as `Unix Makefiles` or `Ninja`. The build system may be specified via `-G "<BUILD_SYSTEM>"` (for example `-G "Ninja"`) at CMake generate command, for example:

```shell
cmake --preset lnms-release -G "Unix Makefiles"
// OR
cmake -B build -G "Unix Makefiles"
```
