# LNMS (local-network-messenger)

LNMS is a simple programm for communication between users in the same network via TCP & UDP sockets.

## Installation

The project can be build via CMake or Python.

Output program is generated in `./build/Release/lnms` or `./build/Debug/lnms` (dependes on chosen configuration)

First, clone the project via git:

```txt
git clone https://github.com/Someth1ngFunny/local-network-messenger.git
cd ./local-network-messenger
```

### 1. CMake

```txt
cmake --preset lnms-release
// OR
cmake -B build
```

```txt
cmake --build build
```

### 2. Python

1. Create venv

```txt
python -m venv .venv
```

2. Install requirements

```txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

// OR (workaround with not UTF-8 character in path)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

3. Install packages

```txt
conan install .

// OR (workaround with not UTF-8 character in path)
python .venv\Scripts\conan.exe install .
```

4. CMake activation (optional, only if you don't have CMake with version >= 3.23)

```txt

build/generators/conanbuild(.sh | .bat | .ps1)

// to deactivate
build/generators/deactivate_conanbuild(.sh | .bat | .ps1)

// If you need .ps1 script files (powershell) rerun 3rd step with flag:
// <COMMAND> --conf=tools.env.virtualenv:powershell=<executable>
```

5. Building via CMake

```txt
cmake --preset lnms-release
// OR DEBUG
cmake --preset lnms-debug
```

```txt
cmake --build build
```

### IDE C++ intellisense configuration

To provide to your IDE information about locations of building libraries include files you need to explicetly set the location of `compile_commands.json` file which might be generated by CMake.

CMake files are already configured to build `compile_commands.json` in `./build` directory, but they are created only if you are building via single-config generators as `Unix Makefiles` or `Ninja`. The build system may be specified via `-G "<BUILD_SYSTEM>"` (for example `-G "Ninja"`) at CMake generate command, for example:

```txt
cmake --preset lnms-release -G "Unix Makefiles"
// OR
cmake -B build -G "Unix Makefiles"
```
